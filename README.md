### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Martin and I enjoy software development. I'm mostly self-taught, starting out (and failing miserably) as a kid with C++ before moving on to languages where I didn't have to think about pointers and memory. Along the way, I tried Delphi and PHP before finding a home in C# and JavaScript. My background is mostly procedural and object oriented. For that reason, I'm very much focusing on exploring some functional alternatives.

As I've grown older, I've realized that I don't know all that much about the fundamental data structures and algorithms that underlie a lot of modern programming. As I result I've decided to try other languages and paradigms to become a better programmer. I've tried some functional programming, starting out making some small web projects using Elm and then getting into Haskell. On the foundations side, I've tried implementing some basic data structures and algorithms in C and C++. While I've enjoyed my time with C and C++, I miss some of the niceties of modern languages so I'm trying to give Rust a go.

Since I've mostly developed software targeting the web, I want to try my hand at some non-web projects. Coming up with ideas can be challenging though.

I've always struggeled with imposter syndrome, but in an attempt to combat it, I've decided to try to commit something to a public repository (almost) every day. While I doubt I will be able to keep up with that commitment, continuously pushing my personal projects to public repositories is the goal. Let's see how well I fare ðŸ˜„

ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm exploring:
 - Go
 - Haskell
 - HTMX
 - C (Learning basic data structures and algorithms)

ðŸŽ¯ In the not too distant future, I want to try:
 - ~Rust~ (I'm too stupid for the borrow checker ðŸ˜­)
 - C++ (Basically a continuation of my C exploration)
 - Game development (since I mostly work with Web stuff normally)
