### Hi there 👋

I like software development and I'm trying to get better while also finding a language and a style that I really like. **C#** is my daily driver - usually combined with TypeScript for web based projects, but I am always trying other languages and technologies. Starting out (and failing miserably) with C++ before moving on to PHP and then C#, my background is mostly procedural and object oriented. For that reason, I'm very much focusing on exploring some functional alternatives. I tried using Elm for my frontends and realized I liked the general feel of the language and tried usuing C# in a (very) functional style before coming to the realization that it was a bad idea - for my sanity if nothing else.

🌱 Right now, I'm exploring:
 - Go
 - Haskell
 - HTMX
 - C (Learning basic data structures and algorithms)

🎯 In the not too distant future, I want to try:
 - ~Rust~ (I'm too stupid for the borrow checker 😭)
 - C++ (Basically a continuation of my C exploration)

I've always struggeled with imposter syndrome, but in an attempt to combat it, I've decided to try to commit something to a public repository (almost) every day. While I doubt I will be able to keep up with that commitment, continuously pushing my personal projects to public repositories is the goal. Let's see how well I fare 😄
