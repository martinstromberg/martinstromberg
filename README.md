### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like software development and I'm trying to get better while also finding a language and a style that I really like. **C#** is my daily driver - usually combined with TypeScript for web based projects, but I am always trying other languages and technologies. Starting out (and failing miserably) with C++ before moving on to PHP and then C#, my background is mostly procedural and object oriented. For that reason, I'm very much focusing on exploring some functional alternatives. I tried using Elm for my frontends and realized I liked the general feel of the language and tried usuing C# in a (very) functional style before coming to the realization that it was a bad idea - for my sanity if nothing else.

ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm exploring:
 - Go
 - Haskell
 - HTMX
